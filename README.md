# SMALL DISCRIPTION OF THE TEXT_GENERATION_MODEL :
To create a text generation model using GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), we first need to understand the key components of both approaches.

# GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer):
GPT is based on the Transformer architecture and is designed for unsupervised learning. It generates text by predicting the next word in a sequence, trained on a large corpus of text data. It uses self-attention mechanisms to process input text and generate outputs, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies and generate highly coherent paragraphs. It works by taking an initial prompt from the user and using the trained model to generate text one word at a time, based on probability distributions learned during training. GPT can generate contextually relevant and coherent paragraphs, making it suitable for applications like content generation, chatbots, and text summarization.
# LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to handle sequential data by learning from previous time steps (or words in text). Unlike basic RNNs, LSTMs are capable of learning long-term dependencies by using specialized memory cells to store information for long periods. Although LSTM models are effective for generating text, they may struggle with maintaining coherence over long passages compared to Transformers like GPT.
# Implementation Example:
In a Jupyter notebook, you would:
Load a pre-trained GPT or LSTM model.
Define a function to take a user prompt.
Generate coherent text using the model's predictive capabilities.
This model can be deployed using Streamlit to allow dynamic text generation based on user input, making it interactive and useful for various applications.
